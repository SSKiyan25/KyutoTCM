## **PERF-0009:** Performance Testing - Application Downgrade Testing

> **Summary:** Verify that the Verch web application can be successfully downgraded from the current version to a previous stable version while maintaining data integrity, performance, and functionality throughout the downgrade process.

**Preconditions:**

- Current version of the application is deployed and functioning correctly in the test environment
- The target downgrade version is identified and verified as a stable, compatible version
- Test environment is set up with Firebase project configured similarly to production
- Complete backup of existing data is available before downgrading
- Firebase Auth and Google OAuth 2.0 API configurations are documented for verification post-downgrade
- Performance monitoring tools are installed and configured to track metrics during the downgrade
- Downgrade documentation and procedures are available and reviewed
- Access to all required build environments and deployment tools is verified
- Test accounts with various permission levels have been created to verify functionality post-downgrade
- System usage statistics from the current version are documented for comparison
- Rollback plan is documented in case the downgrade itself fails (ironically, an upgrade back to current)
